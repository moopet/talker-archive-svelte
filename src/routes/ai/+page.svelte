  <h1>AI use in this project</h1>

  <h2>General disclaimer</h2>

  <p>
    I haven't directly used generative AI working on this project.
  </p>

  <p>
    I don't use AI to write any copy, to summarise any text or to give me code. I like my own words too much.
  </p>

  <p>
    I don't use AI-assistance in my code editor. I've tried it in the past, and it's not for me. The benefits are not there yet - I'd spend more time correcting and debugging code produced by an LLM than I would just writing it in the first place.
  </p>

  <p>
    I do occasionally use AI chat sessions to answer questions where I can't find a good explanation elsewhere or I want to see some comparative points between two libraries, for example.
  </p>

  <h2>Things I've tried out of curiosity</h2>

  <p>
    I've tried using AI to scrape some of the big lists of talkers I've found and convert the data into my preferred formats, but it's frustrating and shows exactly where context in LLMs is still attrocious.<br>
    Theoretically it could have saved a lot of time, but in reality I'd be so suspicious of the output I'd never be happy.
  </p>

  <p>
    I've tried using AI OCR to convert screenshots of login screens to text.<br>
    The results were funny, but not surprising: either missing great chunks or recognising it as ASCII art and replacing chunks with its own stolen pictures of cats.
